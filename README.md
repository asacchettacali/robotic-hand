# robotic-hand
Firmware used to control an artificial hand

The hand is controlled by Leap Motion + Arduino Uno (Standard Firmata, Nodejs & Johnny Five) + Servo Motors and the hand itself was made with Polymorph. It can recognize each finger and it can move them separately with very good precision and sensibility! This prototype can be controlled remotly too via a normal web server using ajax/json requests.
